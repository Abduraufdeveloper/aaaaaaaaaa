Hi there i`m going to write about school club  events 
There was a lot of clubs which take a place at the competition
that was in our school hall at front of entering door
Now  i`m going to write about sequences  of clubs who take a place

1 - astronomy club they start their show with the specified videos 
they show to us a variety of stars for example their names where it 
located , and how much way we should to go to reach there their air 
climat and a lots of different things which  about astronomy

2 -- school choir they start their show with music with choir 
and then they start  one to one do choir and in duo duo is choir 
or music where artist is not one but two after all of their shows 
they start to teach people how to do choir but a lot of people can`t 
do choir  because it causes to their voices  and they can`t do choir

and about audiences they wasn`t really happy but that was pretty cool 
there was teacher  they was judge but a lots of teachers gave their own
club high marks but that wasn`t honesly

My opinion about show that was pretty cool but not  a masterpiece 
honestly i don`t want to go to any of school show because i think 
it is just wasting time 


they should to do shows more shortier because that took a lots of time 
to every people who are taking part in this show and audience 

so that was my writing about school shows 
bye bye
